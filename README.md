**The Divine Proportion(Golden Ratio)** is based on the ratio of one object to another as defined by the number **1.618**. Use of the Divine Proportion is all around us, and is the tool used by artists and sculptors to achieve remarkably accurate proportion and aesthetic composition. The extremely popular book and film, The Da Vinci Code, made mention of the Divine Proportion with regard to **Leonardo da Vinci**’s use of it in several of his paintings. It has been suggested that Leonardo made deliberate use of the Divine Proportion in almost every aspect of his work including such paintings as the **Mona Lisa** and The Last Supper. Throughout history, however, it has been speculated that the golden ratio is prevalent in every aspect of our universe—from the natural growth pattern of the nautilus seashell to the pyramids of Egypt to the musical compositions of Mozart and Beethoven.


I made an **Android App(using JAVA)** which helps one understand what the golden ratio is, in a practical way.
